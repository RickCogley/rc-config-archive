# DO NOT USE THESE RULES without customizing them first!
# Version: 2007/11/16

# For more information, see http://securosis.com/2007/11/15/ipfw-rules/

# These rules *MUST* be customized to your requirements.
# In particular, if you have a private home network (behind an AirPort
# Base Station, Linksys WRT54G, etc.), change "10.42.24.0/24" below to
# your private network range.
# Additionally, allow only ports you actually use; other ports should be
# blocked by the ipfw firewall.
