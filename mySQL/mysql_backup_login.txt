=head1 PROGRAM NAME - Main WEB file for MySQL Backup (from v3.0)
 by Peter Falkenberg Brown
 peterbrown@worldcommunity.com

(Use this file when you run MySQL Backup from the web
 - you don't need it if you run MySQL Backup from the
   shell or from cron.)

This file should be installed in your web tree as the
primary 'script' file to be used to run MySQL Backup.

From this file, we 'require' in the 'real' file,
'mysql_backup.cgi', (check the name below and on your disk)

which should be installed OUTSIDE!!! of your web tree,
in the directory of your choice - usually your 'home' directory,
which is normally ABOVE your web document root directory
where your web 'index.html' file resides.

If your HOME directory is the same as your web document root,
you should change web providers. It's an insecure method.

The rationale behind all this is for security. If the web
server ever outputs a cgi file as text, for some unlikely
reason, then the web visitor would only see this file's
content, rather than the actual script.

Is it necessary? Maybe not, but it doesn't hurt.
